==========================================
Welcome to Protein Finder's documentation!
==========================================

This is a Python script for pulling data out of `NCBI <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/>`_
and `Uniprot <https://www.uniprot.org/>`_ using their APIs. It programmatically
downloads all information found for given search terms in the databases. It
saves biologists hours or even days of time.

These instructions illustrate all the major features of Protein Finder, with
examples. It shows what the script is good for, how to use it and how to
extend its functions.
